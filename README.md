# angularFireQuickDemo
From David East's Tutorial


## Database setup
In order for this demo to work, you need to have your database set up with this structure:
```
your-firebase-application
|
+-angular
  |
  +-object
    |
    +-name: "David"
```
When David does the demo, he is already inside of his `angular` node, which could be confusing if you aren't paying close attention.
